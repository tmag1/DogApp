# DogApp

IOS mobile application that uses URLSession and Firebase. First a [dog image API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) is used to generate random dog images. These images are then added to a Firestore Database. When the application is started and whenever the database is updated, the interface displays all stored dog pictures. Users can add new dog photos by clicking the "Add Photo" button and can delete dog photos by clicking the minus button next to the intended dog image.
